# Ruby
## Intro

Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted language create by Yukihiro Matsumoto ..., most commonly know as Matz, in 1995.

Some characteristics of Ruby:
- Everything is an object. Everything. A method is an object. A free function is an object.
- Duck typing.
- Ruby is know for being slow.
- Ruby raised to prominence with two different events: The PickAxe book by Dave Hunt (coauthor of The Pragmatic Programmer) and the creation of the Ruby on Rails framework by DHH
- Ruby is fun for a programmer. Doesn't get in the way of creating a solution.
- Ruby allows very fast development
- Ruby metaprogramming is powerful. Allows for easily creating DSL.
